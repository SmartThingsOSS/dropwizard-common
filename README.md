Common Dropwizard Modules
=========================

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/SmartThingsOSS/dropwizard-common/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/SmartThingsOSS/dropwizard-common)

This repo is in place to house common dropwizard modules that can be utilized by
dropwizard projects. You are encouraged to use and improve these so that you get
the platform best practices and requirements for "free", and so that issues that
come up can be fixed in one place.

Also the hope is to open source this repo at some once things are fleshed out
further so don't include anything that you wouldn't consider open sourcing.

See each modules documentation for usage details.
